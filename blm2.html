              Soloing is a dangerous game. One mistake—one slip-up—and you’re
              dead. Most climbers will never solo. Those who do have taken a
              very deliberate, intentional step. Once they reach the top of the
              wall or get back down to the ground, they can choose to never risk
              their life again. <br /><br />
              Some of us don’t have that choice. Some of us are always soloing.
              One mistake—one slip up— and we’re dead. The wrong door knocked on
              to get help after an accident. The wrong woman confronted in the
              park about her off-leash dog. The wrong body, the wrong skin
              color, to be given a chance to breathe by a police officer who is
              supposed to be there to keep us safe. <br /><br />
              Black and Brown folks are always soloing. There is no
              spring-loaded camming device of privilege to make sure we are safe
              when we are pulled over for going 10 over the speed limit. There
              is no benefit of the doubt when we are subjected to stop and
              frisk. We have to send. We have to be perfect. And sometimes, even
              when we do everything right, a hold breaks, and there is another
              dead Black or Brown person in the street. <br /><br />
              Access Fund’s mission is to keep climbing areas open and protect
              the climbing environment. The death of George Floyd, and systemic
              racism in our country, specifically anti-Black racism and
              oppression, is an access issue. If you do not even feel safe on
              the sidewalk out front of your house—if you do not even feel safe
              in your own home—how could you possibly feel safe going out to the
              crag, let alone pulling a crux way off the deck? Even if the gate
              to the crag is open, can someone who feels fear for their life
              simply because they’ve stepped outside truly be said to have
              access to our climbing areas? <br /><br />
              We have a moral and social obligation to address these issues. It
              is our responsibility to avidly and wholeheartedly support the
              grassroots organizations and individuals that are already leading
              this struggle. Organizations active in this work right now, like
              Brothers of Climbing, Brown Girls Climb, Flash Foxy,
              Homoclimbtastic, and so many more, are leading the charge on
              making justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion an everyday and
              essential part of climbing. It is our responsibility to do
              everything we can to live up to JEDI principles as an
              organization, and to advocate for a climbing community—and a
              country—where no one is prevented from experiencing the
              life-changing world of climbing because of who they are, where
              they are from, or what they look like. Right now, that means we
              must work to support the Black community in responding to the
              terrible acts of racism and violence in this country. To our Black
              members, friends, and family: we are with you. This is a problem
              we must all show up to address. We recognize we must do more and
              want to reassure you we will continue to do our part to educate
              our members and followers about these issues. <br /><br />
              Every climber knows that solid, steady breathing is key to sending
              at your limit. Without a strong foundation of breath, you’re going
              to pump out and whip. Breathing is something we can do anytime we
              want—for most of us. When the ability to breath becomes an
              afterthought, when BIPOC aren’t soloing and Black people aren’t in
              danger of their lives every time they go for a run or climb—then,
              and only then, will we truly have access for all. <br /><br />
              Until that time, Access Fund will remain committed to JEDI
              principles, and to supporting the struggle for justice in our
              country. Further, we hope that beyond basic safety Black people in
              our country can finally experience the freedom, joy, and healing
              that they deserve. We invite our members and community to hold us
              accountable in growing together and improving Access Fund for all.

              The murder of George Floyd was a tragedy, underpinned by the
              corrosive effects of institutional racism. That's why on June 4,
              2020, we closed all of our North American stores for two hours
              during his memorial services. We stand against racism in all its
              forms, but in this moment, we want to be clear that we are proud
              to say black lives matter. <br /><br /> We are taking additional concrete
              actions to fight racism. It has taken a few days to research what
              we will do and how we will do it. We don't have all of the
              answers, and listening is more important than talking, but here
              are some steps we will take. <br /><br /> 1. We plan to make donations to the
              NAACP Legal Defense Fund and the Marshall Project to advance our
              country's understanding of racism and its root causes and to
              promote equal justice and opportunity. <br /><br /> 2. We plan to follow the lead
              of our employees. When employees choose to make donations to
              501[c]3 non-profits focused on addressing racism, we are offering
              to double match the contributions up to $1,000. <br /><br /> 3. We will help
              individuals and communities exercise the critical right to vote,
              along with others in our industry. <br /><br /> 4. We will continue to speak out
              and be a company that celebrates and encourages diversity. <br /><br /> We are
              working to help end racial injustice. This includes the
              facilitation of education about racism within our own company,
              with ongoing events and dialogue. <br /><br />George Floyd's life mattered.
