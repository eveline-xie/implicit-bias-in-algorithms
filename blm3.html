              As we continue to process this difficult moment, I want to
              acknowledge the real pain expressed by members of our community. I
              also want to acknowledge that the decision I made last week has
              left many of you angry, disappointed and hurt. So I am especially
              grateful that, despite your heartfelt disagreement, you remain
              focused on taking positive steps to move forward. That can't be
              easy, so I just want to say I hear you and I'm grateful. I believe
              our platforms can play a positive role in helping to heal the
              divisions in our society, and I'm committed to making sure our
              work pulls in this direction. To all of you who have already
              worked tirelessly on ideas to improve, I thank you. You're making
              a difference, and together we'll make a difference. And while we
              will continue to stand for giving everyone a voice and erring on
              the side of free expression in these difficult decisions -- even
              when it's speech we strongly and viscerally disagree with -- I'm
              committed to making sure we also fight for voter engagement and
              racial justice too. Many of you have asked what concrete steps we
              can start working on to improve our products and policies. I want
              to share more about the seven areas I discussed at Q&A that we're
              focusing on initially. Based on feedback from employees, civil
              rights experts and subject matter experts internally, we're
              exploring the following areas, which fit into three categories:
              ideas related to specific policies, ideas related to
              decision-making, and proactive initiatives to advance racial
              justice and voter engagement. I want to be clear that while we are
              looking at all of these areas, we may not come up with changes we
              want to make in all of them. Ideas related to specific policies:
              1. We're going to review our policies allowing discussion and
              threats of state use of force to see if there are any amendments
              we should adopt. There are two specific situations under this
              policy that we're going to review. The first is around instances
              of excessive use of police or state force. Given the sensitive
              history in the US, this deserves special consideration. The second
              case is around when a country has ongoing civil unrest or violent
              conflicts. We already have precedents for imposing greater
              restrictions during emergencies and when countries are in ongoing
              states of conflict, so there may be additional policies or
              integrity measures to consider around discussion or threats of
              state use of force when a country is in this state. 2. We're going
              to review our policies around voter suppression to make sure we're
              taking into account the realities of voting in the midst of a
              pandemic. I have confidence in the election integrity efforts
              we've implemented since 2016. We've played a role in protecting
              many elections and now have some of the most advanced systems in
              the world. But there's a good chance that there will be
              unprecedented fear and confusion around going to the polls in
              November, and some will likely try to capitalize on that
              confusion. For example, as politicians debate what the
              vote-by-mail policies should be in different states, what should
              be the line between a legitimate debate about the voting policies
              and attempts to confuse or suppress individuals about how, when or
              where to vote? If a newspaper publishes articles claiming that
              going to polls will be dangerous given Covid, how should we
              determine whether that is health information or voter suppression?
              3. We're going to review potential options for handling violating
              or partially-violating content aside from the binary leave-it-up
              or take-it-down decisions. I know many of you think we should have
              labeled the President's posts in some way last week. Our current
              policy is that if content is actually inciting violence, then the
              right mitigation is to take that content down -- not let people
              continue seeing it behind a flag. There is no exception to this
              policy for politicians or newsworthiness. I think this policy is
              principled and reasonable, but I also respect a lot of the people
              who think there may be better alternatives, so I want to make sure
              we hear all those ideas. I started meeting with the team yesterday
              and we're continuing the discussion soon. In general, I worry that
              this approach has a risk of leading us to editorialize on content
              we don't like even if it doesn't violate our policies, so I think
              we need to proceed very carefully. Ideas related to
              decision-making: 4. We're going to work on establishing a clearer
              and more transparent decision-making process. This is clearly not
              the last difficult decision we're going to have to make, and I
              agree with the feedback from many of you that we should have a
              more transparent process about how we weigh the different values
              and equities at stake, including safety and privacy. I think we
              can provide more transparency into what goes into the policy
              briefings and recommendations that get sent to me. These analyses
              are done thoroughly by Monika Bickert's team and take into account
              many voices. Since I accept the team's recommendations the vast
              majority of the time, this process is where I think we should
              focus most on transparency. For the most sensitive escalations
              where I discuss with the team further rather than just accepting
              their recommendation over email, we can try to outline how we
              incorporate all perspectives into those follow-up discussions as
              well, even though that tends to vary depending on the equities at
              stake in each decision. 5. More broadly, we're going to review
              whether we need to change anything structurally to make sure the
              right groups and voices are at the table -- not only when
              decisions affecting a certain group are being made, but when other
              decisions that may set precedents are being made as well. I'm
              committed to elevating the representation of diversity, inclusion
              and human rights in our processes and management team discussions,
              and I will follow up soon with specific thoughts on how we can
              structurally improve this. Proactive initiatives to advance racial
              justice and voter engagement: 6. We've started a workstream for
              building products to advance racial justice. Many of you have
              shared ideas in the past few days on product improvements we can
              look at, and I've been impressed by how quickly we've moved here.
              I've asked Fidji to be responsible for this work, and Ime will be
              shifting some volunteers from our New Products Experimentation
              team to focus on this as well. They'll have more to share on the
              first set of projects we're planning to take on soon. 7. We're
              building a voter hub to double down on our previous
              get-out-the-vote efforts. At the end of the day, voting is the
              best way to hold our leaders accountable and address many of these
              long term questions about justice. Our efforts will draw on
              lessons we learned from our successful Covid Information Center in
              order to make our voting and civic engagement efforts as central
              as our efforts around Covid recovery. We'll focus on making sure
              everyone has access to accurate and authoritative information
              about voting, as well as building tools to encourage people to
              register to vote and help them encourage their friends and
              communities to vote as well. In 2016, we ran one of the largest
              get out the vote efforts in history. I expect us to do even better
              in 2020. To members of our Black community: I stand with you. Your
              lives matter. Black lives matter. We have so far to go to overcome
              racial injustice in America and around the world, and we all have
              a responsibility and opportunity to change that. I believe our
              platforms will play a positive role in this, but we have work to
              do to make sure our role is as positive as possible. These ideas
              are a starting point and I'm sure we'll find more to do as we
              continue on this journey. I encourage you all to also check out
              Maxine’s post about how you can give direct feedback on product,
              integrity and content policy ideas as well. Thanks for all your
              input so far, and I'm looking forward to making progress together
              over the coming weeks and months.

              Soloing is a dangerous game. One mistake—one slip-up—and you’re
              dead. Most climbers will never solo. Those who do have taken a
              very deliberate, intentional step. Once they reach the top of the
              wall or get back down to the ground, they can choose to never risk
              their life again. <br /><br />
              Some of us don’t have that choice. Some of us are always soloing.
              One mistake—one slip up— and we’re dead. The wrong door knocked on
              to get help after an accident. The wrong woman confronted in the
              park about her off-leash dog. The wrong body, the wrong skin
              color, to be given a chance to breathe by a police officer who is
              supposed to be there to keep us safe. <br /><br />
              Black and Brown folks are always soloing. There is no
              spring-loaded camming device of privilege to make sure we are safe
              when we are pulled over for going 10 over the speed limit. There
              is no benefit of the doubt when we are subjected to stop and
              frisk. We have to send. We have to be perfect. And sometimes, even
              when we do everything right, a hold breaks, and there is another
              dead Black or Brown person in the street. <br /><br />
              Access Fund’s mission is to keep climbing areas open and protect
              the climbing environment. The death of George Floyd, and systemic
              racism in our country, specifically anti-Black racism and
              oppression, is an access issue. If you do not even feel safe on
              the sidewalk out front of your house—if you do not even feel safe
              in your own home—how could you possibly feel safe going out to the
              crag, let alone pulling a crux way off the deck? Even if the gate
              to the crag is open, can someone who feels fear for their life
              simply because they’ve stepped outside truly be said to have
              access to our climbing areas? <br /><br />
              We have a moral and social obligation to address these issues. It
              is our responsibility to avidly and wholeheartedly support the
              grassroots organizations and individuals that are already leading
              this struggle. Organizations active in this work right now, like
              Brothers of Climbing, Brown Girls Climb, Flash Foxy,
              Homoclimbtastic, and so many more, are leading the charge on
              making justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion an everyday and
              essential part of climbing. It is our responsibility to do
              everything we can to live up to JEDI principles as an
              organization, and to advocate for a climbing community—and a
              country—where no one is prevented from experiencing the
              life-changing world of climbing because of who they are, where
              they are from, or what they look like. Right now, that means we
              must work to support the Black community in responding to the
              terrible acts of racism and violence in this country. To our Black
              members, friends, and family: we are with you. This is a problem
              we must all show up to address. We recognize we must do more and
              want to reassure you we will continue to do our part to educate
              our members and followers about these issues. <br /><br />
              Every climber knows that solid, steady breathing is key to sending
              at your limit. Without a strong foundation of breath, you’re going
              to pump out and whip. Breathing is something we can do anytime we
              want—for most of us. When the ability to breath becomes an
              afterthought, when BIPOC aren’t soloing and Black people aren’t in
              danger of their lives every time they go for a run or climb—then,
              and only then, will we truly have access for all. <br /><br />
              Until that time, Access Fund will remain committed to JEDI
              principles, and to supporting the struggle for justice in our
              country. Further, we hope that beyond basic safety Black people in
              our country can finally experience the freedom, joy, and healing
              that they deserve. We invite our members and community to hold us
              accountable in growing together and improving Access Fund for all.

              The murder of George Floyd was a tragedy, underpinned by the
              corrosive effects of institutional racism. That's why on June 4,
              2020, we closed all of our North American stores for two hours
              during his memorial services. We stand against racism in all its
              forms, but in this moment, we want to be clear that we are proud
              to say black lives matter. <br /><br />
              We are taking additional concrete actions to fight racism. It has
              taken a few days to research what we will do and how we will do
              it. We don't have all of the answers, and listening is more
              important than talking, but here are some steps we will take.
              <br /><br />
              1. We plan to make donations to the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and
              the Marshall Project to advance our country's understanding of
              racism and its root causes and to promote equal justice and
              opportunity. <br /><br />
              2. We plan to follow the lead of our employees. When employees
              choose to make donations to 501[c]3 non-profits focused on
              addressing racism, we are offering to double match the
              contributions up to $1,000. <br /><br />
              3. We will help individuals and communities exercise the critical
              right to vote, along with others in our industry. <br /><br />
              4. We will continue to speak out and be a company that celebrates
              and encourages diversity. <br /><br />
              We are working to help end racial injustice. This includes the
              facilitation of education about racism within our own company,
              with ongoing events and dialogue. <br /><br />George Floyd's life
              mattered. <br /><br />
