              As we continue to process this difficult moment, I want to
              acknowledge the real pain expressed by members of our community. I
              also want to acknowledge that the decision I made last week has
              left many of you angry, disappointed and hurt. So I am especially
              grateful that, despite your heartfelt disagreement, you remain
              focused on taking positive steps to move forward. That can't be
              easy, so I just want to say I hear you and I'm grateful.
              <br /><br />
              I believe our platforms can play a positive role in helping to
              heal the divisions in our society, and I'm committed to making
              sure our work pulls in this direction. To all of you who have
              already worked tirelessly on ideas to improve, I thank you. You're
              making a difference, and together we'll make a difference. And
              while we will continue to stand for giving everyone a voice and
              erring on the side of free expression in these difficult decisions
              -- even when it's speech we strongly and viscerally disagree with
              -- I'm committed to making sure we also fight for voter engagement
              and racial justice too. <br /><br />
              Many of you have asked what concrete steps can start working on to
              improve our products and policies. I want to share more about the
              seven areas I discussed at Q&A that we're focusing on initially.
              Based on feedback from employees, civil rights experts and subject
              matter experts internally, we're exploring the following areas,
              which fit into three categories: ideas related to specific
              policies, ideas related to decision-making, and proactive
              initiatives to advance racial justice and voter engagement. I want
              to be clear that while we are looking at all of these areas, we
              may not come up with changes we want to make in all of them.
              <br /><br />
              Ideas related to specific policies: <br /><br />
              1. We're going to review our policies allowing discussion and
              threats of state use of force to see if there are any amendments
              we should adopt. There are two specific situations under this
              policy that we're going to review. The first is around instances
              of excessive use of police or state force. Given the sensitive
              history in the US, this deserves special consideration. The second
              case is around when a country has ongoing civil unrest or violent
              conflicts. We already have precedents for imposing greater
              restrictions during emergencies and when countries are in ongoing
              states of conflict, so there may be additional policies or
              integrity measures to consider around discussion or threats of
              state use of force when a country is in this state. <br /><br />
              2. We're going to review our policies around voter suppression to
              make sure we're taking into account the realities of voting in the
              midst of a pandemic. I have confidence in the election integrity
              efforts we've implemented since 2016. We've played a role in
              protecting many elections and now have some of the most advanced
              systems in the world. But there's a good chance that there will be
              unprecedented fear and confusion around going to the polls in
              November, and some will likely try to capitalize on that
              confusion. For example, as politicians debate what the
              vote-by-mail policies should be in different states, what should
              be the line between a legitimate debate about the voting policies
              and attempts to confuse or suppress individuals about how, when or
              where to vote? If a newspaper publishes articles claiming that
              going to polls will be dangerous given Covid, how should we
              determine whether that is health information or voter suppression?
              <br /><br />
              3. We're going to review potential options for handling violating
              or partially-violating content aside from the binary leave-it-up
              or take-it-down decisions. I know many of you think we should have
              labeled the President's posts in some way last week. Our current
              policy is that if content is actually inciting violence, then the
              right mitigation is to take that content down -- not let people
              continue seeing it behind a flag. There is no exception to this
              policy for politicians or newsworthiness. I think this policy is
              principled and reasonable, but I also respect a lot of the people
              who think there may be better alternatives, so I want to make sure
              we hear all those ideas. I started meeting with the team yesterday
              and we're continuing the discussion soon. In general, I worry that
              this approach has a risk of leading us to editorialize on content
              we don't like even if it doesn't violate our policies, so I think
              we need to proceed very carefully. <br /><br />
              Ideas related to decision-making: <br /><br />
              4. We're going to work on establishing a clearer and more
              transparent decision-making process. This is clearly not the last
              difficult decision we're going to have to make, and I agree with
              the feedback from many of you that we should have a more
              transparent process about how we weigh the different values and
              equities at stake, including safety and privacy. I think we can
              provide more transparency into what goes into the policy briefings
              and recommendations that get sent to me. These analyses are done
              thoroughly by Monika Bickert's team and take into account many
              voices. Since I accept the team's recommendations the vast
              majority of the time, this process is where I think we should
              focus most on transparency. For the most sensitive escalations
              where I discuss with the team further rather than just accepting
              their recommendation over email, we can try to outline how we
              incorporate all perspectives into those follow-up discussions as
              well, even though that tends to vary depending on the equities at
              stake in each decision. <br /><br />
              5. More broadly, we're going to review whether we need to change
              anything structurally to make sure the right groups and voices are
              at the table -- not only when decisions affecting a certain group
              are being made, but when other decisions that may set precedents
              are being made as well. I'm committed to elevating the
              representation of diversity, inclusion and human rights in our
              processes and management team discussions, and I will follow up
              soon with specific thoughts on how we can structurally improve
              this. Proactive initiatives to advance racial justice and voter
              engagement: <br /><br />
              6. We've started a workstream for building products to advance
              racial justice. Many of you have shared ideas in the past few days
              on product improvements we can look at, and I've been impressed by
              how quickly we've moved here. I've asked Fidji to be responsible
              for this work, and Ime will be shifting some volunteers from our
              New Products Experimentation team to focus on this as well.
              They'll have more to share on the first set of projects we're
              planning to take on soon. <br /><br />
              7. We're building a voter hub to double down on our previous
              get-out-the-vote efforts. At the end of the day, voting is the
              best way to hold our leaders accountable and address many of these
              long term questions about justice. Our efforts will draw on
              lessons we learned from our successful Covid Information Center in
              order to make our voting and civic engagement efforts as central
              as our efforts around Covid recovery. We'll focus on making sure
              everyone has access to accurate and authoritative information
              about voting, as well as building tools to encourage people to
              register to vote and help them encourage their friends and
              communities to vote as well. In 2016, we ran one of the largest
              get out the vote efforts in history. I expect us to do even better
              in 2020. <br /><br />
              To members of our Black community: I stand with you. Your lives
              matter. Black lives matter. <br /><br />
              We have so far to go to overcome racial injustice in America and
              around the world, and we all have a responsibility and opportunity
              to change that. I believe our platforms will play a positive role
              in this, but we have work to do to make sure our role is as
              positive as possible. These ideas are a starting point and I'm
              sure we'll find more to do as we continue on this journey. I
              encourage you all to also check out Maxine’s post about how you
              can give direct feedback on product, integrity and content policy
              ideas as well. Thanks for all your input so far, and I'm looking
              forward to making progress together over the coming weeks and
              months.

              <b>Speaking up on racism</b><br />Right now, there is a pain
              deeply etched in the soul of our nation and in the hearts of
              millions. To stand together, we must stand up for one another, and
              recognize the fear, hurt, and outrage rightly provoked by the
              senseless killing of George Floyd and a much longer history of
              racism. <br /><br />
              That painful past is still present today — not only in the form of
              violence, but in the everyday experience of deeply rooted
              discrimination. We see it in our criminal justice system, in the
              disproportionate toll of disease on Black and Brown communities,
              in the inequalities in neighborhood services and the educations
              our children receive. <br /><br />
              While our laws have changed, the reality is that their protections
              are still not universally applied. We’ve seen progress since the
              America I grew up in, but it is similarly true that communities of
              color continue to endure discrimination and trauma. <br /><br />
              I have heard from so many that you feel afraid — afraid in your
              communities, afraid in your daily lives, and, most cruelly of all,
              afraid in your own skin. We can have no society worth celebrating
              unless we can guarantee freedom from fear for every person who
              gives this country their love, labor, and life. <br /><br />
              At Apple, our mission has been and always will be to create
              technology that empowers people to change the world for the
              better. We’ve always drawn strength from diversity, welcomed
              people from every walk of life to our stores around the world, and
              strived to build an Apple that is inclusive of everyone.
              <br /><br />
              But we must do more. We commit to continuing our work to bring
              critical resources and technology to underserved school systems.
              We commit to continuing to fight the forces of environmental
              injustice — like climate change — which disproportionately harm
              Black communities and other communities of color. We commit to
              looking inward and pushing progress forward on inclusion and
              diversity, so that every great idea can be heard. And we’re
              donating to organizations including the Equal Justice Initiative,
              which challenge racial injustice and mass incarceration.
              <br /><br />
              To create change, we have to reexamine our own views and actions
              in light of a pain that is deeply felt but too often ignored.
              Issues of human dignity will not abide standing on the sidelines.
              To the Black community — we see you. You matter and your lives
              matter. <br /><br />
              This is a moment when many people may want nothing more than a
              return to normalcy, or to a status quo that is only comfortable if
              we avert our gaze from injustice. As difficult as it may be to
              admit, that desire is itself a sign of privilege. George Floyd’s
              death is shocking and tragic proof that we must aim far higher
              than a “normal” future, and build one that lives up to the highest
              ideals of equality and justice. <br /><br />
              In the words of Martin Luther King Jr., “Every society has its
              protectors of status quo and its fraternities of the indifferent
              who are notorious for sleeping through revolutions. Today, our
              very survival depends on our ability to stay awake, to adjust to
              new ideas, to remain vigilant and to face the challenge of
              change.” <br /><br />
              With every breath we take, we must commit to being that change,
              and to creating a better, more just world for everyone.<br /><br />

              <b>Our commitments to racial equity</b><br />Hi everyone,
              <br /><br />
              Over the past several weeks, violent and racist attacks against
              the Black community have forced the world to reckon with the
              structural and systemic racism that Black people have experienced
              over generations. My own search for answers started within our own
              walls. Listening to the personal accounts of members of our Black
              Leadership Advisory Group and our Black+ Googlers has only
              reinforced for me the reality our Black communities face: one
              where systemic racism permeates every aspect of life, from
              interactions with law enforcement, to access to housing and
              capital, to health care, education, and the workplace.
              <br /><br />
              As a company, and as individuals who came here to build helpful
              products for everyone, Google commits to translating the energy of
              this moment into lasting, meaningful change. Today we are
              announcing a set of concrete commitments to move that work
              forward: internally, to build sustainable equity for Google’s
              Black+ community, and externally, to make our products and
              programs helpful in the moments that matter most to Black users.
              <br /><br />
              <b>Building sustainable equity</b> <br />
              Creating meaningful change starts within our own company.
              Strengthening our commitment to racial equity and inclusion will
              help Google build more helpful products for our users and the
              world. To that end, we’re announcing several commitments to build
              sustainable equity for our Black+ community. <br /><br />
              First, we’re working to improve Black+ representation at senior
              levels and committing to a goal to improve leadership
              representation of underrepresented groups by 30 percent by 2025.
              To help achieve this, we’ll post senior leadership roles
              externally as well as internally, and increase our investments in
              places such as Atlanta, Washington DC, Chicago, and London, where
              we already have offices. We'll take the same approach across
              regions, using site and country-specific plans to recruit and hire
              more underrepresented Googlers in communities where the social
              infrastructure already supports a sense of belonging and
              contributes to a better quality of life. <br /><br />
              Second, we’ll do more to address representation challenges and
              focus on hiring, retention, and promotion at all levels. To help
              direct that work, I’m establishing a new talent liaison within
              each product and functional area to mentor and advocate for the
              progression and retention of Googlers from underrepresented
              groups. I’m also convening a task force, including senior members
              of the Black+ community at Google, to develop concrete
              recommendations and proposals for accountability across all of the
              areas that affect the Black+ Googler experience, from recruiting
              and hiring, to performance management, to career progression and
              retention. I’ve asked the task force to come back with specific
              proposals (including measurable goals) within 90 days.
              <br /><br />
              Third, we’re working to create a stronger sense of inclusion and
              belonging for Googlers in general and our Black+ community in
              particular. Our internal research shows that feelings of belonging
              are driven by many aspects of our experiences at work, including
              the psychological safety we feel among our teams, the support of
              our managers and leaders, equitable people processes, and
              opportunities to grow and develop our careers. Across all of these
              dimensions, we’re committed to building more inclusive practices
              and policies—and revisiting them when we don’t get them right.
              <br /><br />
              As one example, we’ve had a security practice of Googlers watching
              for “tailgaters” in order to reduce instances of unauthorized
              visitors in offices. We have realized this process is susceptible
              to bias. So, over the past year, our Global Security and
              Resilience team partnering with a cross-functional working group,
              conducted extensive research, listened to Black Googlers’
              experiences, and developed and tested new security procedures to
              ensure we could maintain the safety and security of the Google
              community without relying on this type of enforcement. Now, as we
              prepare to return to the office, we will end the practice of
              Googlers badge-checking each other and rely on our already robust
              security infrastructure. <br /><br />
              Fourth, we’ll establish a range of anti-racism educational
              programs that are global in view and able to scale to all
              Googlers. We’ll be welcoming external experts into Google to share
              their expertise on racial history and structural inequities, and
              start conversations on education, allyship, and self-reflection.
              And this week we’ve begun piloting a new, multi-series training
              for Googlers of all levels that explores systemic racism and
              racial consciousness, to help develop stronger awareness and
              capacity for creating spaces where everyone feels they belong. We
              plan to roll out this training globally by early next year. We’ll
              also integrate diversity, equity, and inclusion into our mandatory
              manager trainings. <br /><br />
              Fifth, we’re focused on better supporting the mental and physical
              health and well-being of our Black+ community. For example, over
              the past year, we’ve worked with our mental health provider in the
              U.S., to increase their Black network of counselors. Our global
              EAP providers are also working to further diversify their network
              of counselors. Over the next 90 days, our Benefits team will work
              with the Equity Project Management Office and Black Leadership
              Advisory Group to identify areas where we could expand our
              benefits or provide additional support to Googlers and their
              families. As one example of the kinds of programs that work: we've
              made the medical second opinion service available to Googlers’
              extended family—something that our Black+ community told us was
              important to supporting a family structure that includes siblings,
              parents, parents-in-law and grandparents. <br /><br />
              <b>Building products for change </b><br />
              Turning to our external announcements, we want to create products
              and programs that help Black users in the moments that matter
              most. Two weeks ago, I put out a call for ideas, and Googlers from
              all over the world have submitted more than 500 suggestions. We’ve
              assembled a product task force to prioritize and implement these
              ideas in partnership with our Black Leadership Advisory Group and
              members of our Black Googler Network. <br /><br />Some activations
              have already launched, including the Assistant’s responses to
              questions related to Black Lives Matter and—as of this
              week—Juneteenth. We're also working quickly to give merchants in
              the U.S. the option of adding a “Black-owned” business attribute
              to their Business Profile on Google to help people find and
              support Black-owned local businesses by using Search and Maps.
              This opt-in feature is in development and will roll out to
              Business Profiles in the coming weeks. <br /><br />
              Creating products for everyone is a core principle at Google, so
              our product teams will work to ensure that all users, and
              particularly Black users, see themselves reflected in our
              products. In addition, building on YouTube's announcement last
              week, our Trust and Safety team will work to strengthen our
              product policies against hate and harassment. <br /><br />
              <b>Helping create economic opportunity</b><br />
              Beyond our products, we know that racial equity is inextricably
              linked to economic opportunity. So today we are announcing a $175
              million+ economic opportunity package to support Black business
              owners, startup founders, job seekers and developers, in addition
              to YouTube’s $100 million fund to amplify Black creators and
              artists. This new commitment includes: $50 million in financing
              and grants for small businesses, focused on the Black community
              and in partnership with Opportunity Finance Network. This
              commitment builds on our recent $125 million Grow with Google
              Small Business Fund that is helping underserved minority and
              women-owned small businesses across the U.S. <br /><br />
              $100 million in funding participation in Black-led capital firms,
              startups and organizations supporting Black entrepreneurs,
              including increased investments in Plexo Capital and non-dilutive
              funding to Black founders in the Google for Startups network.
              <br /><br />
              $15 million in training, through partners like the National Urban
              League, to help Black jobseekers grow their skills. <br /><br />
              $10 million+ to help improve the Black community’s access to
              education, equipment and economic opportunities in our developer
              ecosystem, and increase equity, representation and inclusion
              across our developer platforms, including Android, Chrome,
              Flutter, Firebase, Google Play and more. <br /><br />
              Mentorship is also critical to growing networks and successful
              businesses. Today, we are launching our Google for Startups
              Accelerator for Black Founders, a three-month digital accelerator
              program for high potential Seed to Series A startups and
              announcing an expansion of our Digital Coaches program to 8 new
              cities, including Memphis, Birmingham, and Cleveland, to provide
              50K Black-owned businesses in the U.S. with the mentorship,
              networking and training they need to grow. <br /><br />
              <b>Improving education</b><br />
              We’re also committing nearly $3 million to help close the racial
              equity gaps in computer science education and increase Black+
              representation in STEM fields. This starts with making sure Black
              students have access to opportunities early on in their education.
              To that end, we’re expanding our CS First curriculum to 7,000 more
              teachers who reach 100,000+ Black students, scaling our Applied
              Digital Skills program to reach 400,000 Black middle and high
              school students, and making a $1 million Google.org grant to the
              DonorsChoose #ISeeMe campaign, to help teachers access materials
              to make their classrooms more inclusive. <br /><br />
              Beyond the classroom, we’re increasing our exploreCSR awards to 16
              more universities to address racial gaps in CS research &
              academia, and we’re also supporting Black in AI with $250,000 to
              help increase Black representation in the field of AI.
              <br /><br />
              These efforts build on our other education initiatives, including
              CodeNext, focused on cultivating the next generation of Black and
              Latinx tech leaders, and TechExchange, which partners with
              historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and
              Hispanic-serving Institutions (HSIs) to bring students to Google’s
              campus for four months to learn about topics from product
              management to machine learning.<br /><br />
              <b>Supporting racial justice organizations</b><br />
              We also continue to support organizations working to advance
              criminal justice reform. Earlier this month, Google.org pledged
              another $12 million, in addition to the $32 million we’ve already
              contributed since the Charleston shooting five years ago today.
              We’re announcing the next round of grants—at $1 million each—to
              the Leadership Conference Education Fund, the NAACP Legal Defense
              and Educational Fund’s Policing Reform Campaign and the Movement
              for Black Lives. We’ve also created a public donation page to help
              raise even more for organizations fighting against racism and
              inequality. Recognizing that racism is a problem the world over,
              looking ahead, we will focus on more global solutions, and will be
              giving grants to local community organizations tackling these
              issues in Brazil, and across Europe and Africa. <br /><br />
              Let me close by simply saying thank you to the many Googlers who
              have come together to drive these efforts. That includes our Chief
              Diversity Officer Melonie Parker and the Employee Engagement team,
              our Equity Project Management Office working in partnership with
              our Black Leadership Advisory Group and members of our Black
              Googler Network, and everyone who has stepped up with ideas on how
              we can build a better workplace, and, in turn, better products for
              the world. <br /><br />
