              We grieve the killing of George Floyd, alongside the Black
              community, and the world, as we continue to grieve an already too
              long list of racial injustice victims. These losses are
              devastatingly painful. We are at a pivotal moment where it is
              critical that we better understand and appreciate one another,
              recognize that in our diversity lies strength, and commit to be
              allies for one another. <br /><br />
              We understand that navigating the pain, anger, anxiety and fear
              that the events of recent days have brought forward is
              tremendously challenging. We also understand that we don’t have
              all the answers, and frankly, many of us can’t know what it’s like
              to be faced with systemic racism every day of our lives. But we
              are committed to moving forward together, providing our employees
              the resources they need, and being a force for change.

              At realtor.com, we stand with the Black community, and for the
              right of every person to be who they are, to be seen, accepted,
              and supported, in all their uniqueness and significance. We
              celebrate the many amazing histories and experiences and
              perspectives we all bring to our work, to our families and our

              philanthropy, both inside and outside our walls.

          <div class="collapse" id="second">
            <div class="card card-body">
              Last week, Zillow released a simple message: “Racism has no home
              here.” This message expresses our commitment to creating a
              workplace where everyone feels like they belong, and promoting
              equity, justice and fairness in our company, our communities and
              across our platform and operations. <br /><br />
              We’ve been asked what we are doing to fight racism. The short
              answer is: not enough. Racism is pervasive. Too many stare it in
              the face daily. Racism is also present in real estate. We
              understand that our commitments and our accountability must be
              significantly stronger and deeper if we truly want and expect any
              change. We can and will do more. <br /><br />
              As the protests against racism and police brutality in response to
              the death of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and more
              began erupting around the globe, I had multiple opportunities to
              sit down virtually with Zillow’s Black employees from our Billow
              (Black/African ancestry) affinity network to listen. I heard fear,
              anger, pain and exhaustion. Their candor deepened my understanding
              of the systemic racism that they — and every member of the Black
              community — have experienced all their lives. I realized that my
              anger and personal revulsion over this brutal stream of racist
              acts are negligible in relation to what Black people are feeling
              right now. Black Lives Matter, and their need is urgent.
              <br /><br />
              At Zillow, we were founded on the value of “turning on the lights”
              — letting the truth of a situation shine through and giving power
              to the people. We believe it is our responsibility — as a
              corporation, a society and as humans — to bring change. As a
              company, we are focused on addressing inequities and promoting
              diversity in our own workplaces, and using the power of our
              platform to shine the light on racial and housing injustice, and
              taking steps to end it through our people, research and advocacy,
              products, business practices and social investments and
              partnerships. <br /><br />
              Our company. As an employer, we want to ensure we foster an
              equitable culture in which everyone feels like they belong. We
              maintain mandatory training about managing bias, inclusive
              interviewing practices, and equity and belonging for all, and
              robust manager training around inclusion. And we support nine
              employee affinity networks including Billow; more than half of our
              employees belong to one or more. <br /><br />
              We are also committed to improving the diversity of our workforce
              and leadership and providing great careers and advancement
              opportunities. Earlier this year, we implemented new recruiting
              methods to attract and create opportunities for a diverse group of
              candidates. Last year, we started publishing statistics about the
              diversity of our employees and leadership team. While we’ve made
              some progress, it’s clearly not enough. We can and will do more.
              <br /><br />
              Our research, education and advocacy. We will continue to leverage
              the power of our data and economic research to illuminate the
              historical inequities and discrimination that plague the housing
              sector. There’s no justice in the fact that Black mortgage
              applicants are denied at twice the rate of white applicants, and
              the gap between the Black and white home ownership rates is wider
              now than it was in 1900. <br /><br />
              We will continue to partner with groups like the National Fair
              Housing Alliance and the Urban League to help identify gaps and do
              more to advocate for change, solutions and justice. This includes
              calling on our government to take action and pass laws to fight
              racism and hate, as we did in Georgia this week. <br /><br />
              Our products, technology and operations. As a company rooted in
              technology, we’re assembling some of Zillow’s top product, design
              and business people to determine more ways our products and
              operations can enable more justice, equality and fairness in our
              communities. To help house more of our low-income and homeless
              neighbors, we support and invest in Housing Connector, a
              Seattle-area nonprofit organization that launched last year to
              help eliminate the barriers that can keep individuals of color
              from accessing homes. The search tool we built for Housing
              Connector has helped 745 people find homes in the last 10 months,
              70% of whom are people of color. While these are steps in the
              right direction, we must do more. We invite the whole real estate
              sector to step up and work together to create a more equitable
              market. <br /><br />
              Nonprofit investment and partnership. Over the past five years,
              Zillow contributed $5 million to help support underserved
              communities in their pursuit of home. We have pledged at least $1
              million over the next 12 months to support lasting partnerships to
              fight racism and discrimination and work toward fair and equal
              access to housing for all. We have donated to the NAACP in
              Minneapolis, where we have local operations and employees, and are
              deepening our partnership with the National Fair Housing Alliance
              to support a level playing field in the American dream of home. In
              the weeks and months ahead, we will further expand our nonprofit
              partnership base to fight racial injustice. <br /><br />
              Personally, my wife, Sarah, and I will increase our own efforts to
              fight injustice. We have been longtime supporters of fighting
              racial inequities in our criminal justice system, including
              working toward decarceration of our prisons, where Black inmates
              outnumber white inmates 5:1. Thanks to Sarah, this has been the
              primary focus of our philanthropy for several years, as we support
              the fight to address bias based on race in our justice system.
              <br /><br />
              At Zillow, we stand with our Black employees, the Black community
              and all underrepresented people against racism and inequity. The
              river of pain and anger flowing through our country right now
              demands our attention and more action. Racism has no home here —
              but words are not enough. We all must do more. We are committed to
              doing so. <br /><br />

          <div class="collapse" id="third">
            <div class="card card-body">
              To Our Redfin Community: <br /><br /> On May 31, Redfin joined many other
              people and companies denouncing racism and racial violence. We
              believe Black Lives Matter and we support police reform, but we’re
              writing today about a more fundamental responsibility our company
              has to address racism: integration. <br /><br />
              We can’t come together for a protest and then return to life in
              different worlds. We can heal our society’s great wound only if
              Black people and white people live side by side, with the same
              schools, grocery stores and job opportunities. This requires every
              real estate agent to approach our jobs differently. <br /><br />
              Exclusivity isn’t an occasional problem in the real estate
              industry; it has been a founding premise. Homebuyers seeking a
              coveted neighborhood don’t pay $10,000 in fees for agents to
              complete a contract or show a home. An agent earns those fees by
              finding a way for her customers to get the loan others couldn’t,
              the listings others overlooked, the deal done with an agent she
              has known for years. The result can change a family’s trajectory
              across generations. <br /><br />
              At Redfin, we’re creating a world where no one has to know the
              secret handshake to get the loan, the listing or the deal. In the
              meantime, our job as agents is to pursue these advantages for each
              of our customers with zeal. That obligates us to pursue each
              customer with zeal, whether that customer is Black or white, new
              to home-buying or an old hand. <br /><br />
              Equal service should be the norm in our industry, but it isn’t.
              Industry-wide studies in 2018 and 2019 show that white people get
              much better real estate service than Black people with the same
              finances. That difference perpetuates segregated neighborhoods.
              <br /><br />
              This is why Redfin’s mission to redefine real estate in your favor
              has long included a special commitment to our customers of color.
              At Redfin’s 2020 kickoff meeting, we trained our agents and
              lenders on racism in real estate. In 2019, we successfully
              campaigned to eliminate pocket listings that can prevent minority
              homebuyers from seeing the most desirable homes for sale.
              <br /><br />
              In 2018, we hosted an industry event on racism featuring our
              agents, customers and academics. We’ve supported controversial
              business taxes to fund more housing, and controversial zoning for
              more integrated neighborhoods. The representation of people of
              color in our workforce has increased from 34% in 2018 to 35% in
              2019 to 36% in 2020; it’s now more than double the industry
              average. <br /><br />
              But after George Floyd’s death, we came to a reckoning that our
              efforts haven’t been enough. Redfin decided last week to base a
              significant portion of next year’s executive bonuses on goals to
              increase the company’s overall diversity, and the diversity of our
              executives and board members. By the end of 2020, Redfin’s leaders
              have committed the first funding for a million-dollar-plus
              philanthropic effort to increase housing access for low-income or
              under-served communities. <br /><br />
              This summer, we’re extending inclusive-management training from
              our brokerage’s managers to all our managers. And we’re exploring
              how we can keep broadening the range of lower-income neighborhoods
              and rural towns we serve.<br /><br />
              But our first obligation is to fight for you the Black homebuyer —
              and also the veteran homebuyer, the Latinx homebuyer, the Asian
              homebuyer, the gay homebuyer, every homebuyer — using all our
              capabilities as top-producing local agents and lenders, and all of
              our technology: to embrace your aspirations, and to give you every
              advantage when buying a home, especially in neighborhoods where
              you’ve historically been shut out. <br /><br />
              This may seem like the least we can do, but it’s what’s most
              important, and we don’t take it for granted. If we ever fail to
              treat you fairly, I want to know about it. You can contact me
              directly, and we’ll make it right. We believe in your dream of a
              better life, for your family, and for our society. <br /><br />
